What Drives the Price of a Used Car

1. Business Understanding

The goal is to identify which factors most strongly influence used-car prices and to build interpretable regression models that quantify each factor’s impact. This supports better pricing decisions for a marketplace, dealership, or pricing tool.

2. Data Cleaning Summary

Key cleaning steps included:

Removing missing/invalid prices

Limiting prices to a realistic range

Restricting vehicle years to 1990–2022

Capping extreme mileage values

Dropping high-missingness or high-cardinality fields

Ensuring critical fields (manufacturer, condition, transmission, etc.) were present

This produced a clean dataset suitable for modeling.

3. Descriptive Insights

Newer vehicles are more expensive.

Higher mileage reduces price.

Premium manufacturers show higher median prices; economy brands show lower.

Better condition corresponds to higher prices.

Vehicle type and drivetrain affect pricing (SUVs, trucks, AWD tend to be higher).

These trends align with expectations from the used-car market.

4. Modeling Results
Linear Regression (baseline)

CV RMSE ≈ $8K

Newer year increases price; mileage decreases it.

Manufacturer, condition, and vehicle type show clear price differences.

Ridge Regression

Slightly lower RMSE than Linear Regression

More stable coefficients

Interpretation remains straightforward

Overall: Year, mileage, manufacturer, and condition are the strongest drivers of price.

5. Actionable Insights

Use the Ridge model to generate a recommended price range for listings.

Flag listings priced far above/below model expectations.

Highlight key value drivers (low mileage, newer year, condition) to users.

Encourage sellers to provide full vehicle details for more accurate pricing.

6. Recommendation to the Used Car Dealership

Based on the analysis and the regression models, consumers most strongly value the following attributes in a used car:

Newer Model Years
Newer cars consistently command higher prices, even when controlling for mileage and other features.
Recommendation: Prioritize acquiring late-model inventory and highlight model year prominently in listings.

Lower Mileage
Mileage is one of the largest negative predictors of price; each additional 10,000 miles reduces value noticeably.
Recommendation: Stock lower-mileage vehicles when possible and price high-mileage inventory more aggressively to stay competitive.

Good or Excellent Condition
Condition variables (“excellent,” “like new,” etc.) show strong positive effects in the model.
Recommendation: Invest in reconditioning vehicles and accurately documenting condition. Buyers pay more for vehicles presented as well-maintained.

Reputable Manufacturers
Brands such as Toyota, Honda, BMW, and other premium or reliable manufacturers have positive coefficients relative to baseline brands.
Recommendation: Prioritize brands with strong consumer trust and historically high resale value.

Desirable Vehicle Types and Drivetrains
SUVs, trucks, and AWD vehicles tended to be priced higher than sedans and FWD vehicles.

Recommendation: Increase inventory in higher-demand segments like SUVs and trucks to maximize margins.
